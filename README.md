# Minesweeper Game in Python

## Introduction

Welcome to the Minesweeper game implemented in Python! Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where your objective is to uncover all the cells on the game board without detonating any mines. It's a test of logic and strategy, and it can be quite addictive!

## How to Play

### Objective

The objective of Minesweeper is to uncover all the cells on the game board that do not contain mines.

### Rules

1. The game board is divided into a grid of cells. Some cells contain mines, while others are safe to uncover.

2. You can click on a cell to uncover it. If it contains a mine, you lose the game.

3. If you uncover a cell that does not contain a mine, it will display a number. This number indicates the number of mines in the neighbouring cells (adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

4. Use the numbers on the cells to deduce the location of mines. For example, if a cell displays "3," it means that there are three mines in the neighbouring cells.

5. You can mark cells that you suspect contain mines with a flag. This can help you keep track of potential mine locations.

6. To win the game, you must successfully uncover all the safe cells without triggering any mines.

### Controls

- Left-click: Uncover a cell.
- Right-click: Place or remove a flag on a cell to mark it as a suspected mine.
